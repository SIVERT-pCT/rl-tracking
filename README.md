# Towards Neural Charged Particle Tracking in Digital Tracking Calorimeters with Reinforcement Learning
[Tobias Kortus, Ralf Keidel, Nicolas R. Gauger](https://sivert.info), on behalf of *the Bergen pCT* collaboration

The repository contains the Pytorch implementation of "Towards Neural Charged Particle Tracking in Digital Tracking Calorimeters with Reinforcement Learning"


> We propose a novel reconstruction scheme for reconstructing charged particles in digital tracking calorimeters using model-free reinforcement learning aiming to benefit from the rapid progress and success of neural network architectures for tracking without the dependency on simulated or manually labeled data. Here we optimize by trial-and-error a behavior policy acting as a heuristic approximation to the full combinatorial optimization problem, maximizing the physical plausibility of sampled trajectories.
